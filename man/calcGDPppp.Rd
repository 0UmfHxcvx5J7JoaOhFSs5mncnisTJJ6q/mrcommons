\description{
Merges time series of GDP in Purchase Power Parity (PPP) of International
Dollars of the year 2005.  The source is selected in the config file. See
\code{\link{calcGDPpppPast}} for past datasets, and
\code{\link{calcGDPpppFuture}} for future datasets. The time series are
merged via the growth rates. The first year of the future scenarios
determines the merging point. All data is calibrated either to the "past" or
the "future" dataset as specified in "getConfig()$calc$PopulationCalib".

table 2.13 Then, the 2011 estimate is extrapolated with the GDP projection
in local currency units (LCU), as these growth rates should be approximately
what the growth models predict. The price index from 2011 was transformed
into 2005 equivalents using the inflation rate of the United States(US), as
the PPPs are in USDollar equvialents. \item \code{PWP}: Penn World Tables }
