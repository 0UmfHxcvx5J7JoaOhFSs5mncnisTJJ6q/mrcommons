calcNitrogenBudgetCropland(
  cellular = FALSE,
  deposition = "CEDS",
  include_fertilizer = TRUE,
  max_snupe = 0.85
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cellular}{disaggregated to 0.5 degree grid}

\item{deposition}{if FALSE, deposition is not accounted for in the distribution.
Use FALSE to avoid circularities in calcNitrogenBudget}

\item{include_fertilizer}{including fertilizer in budget. Use FALSE to avoid circularities in specific cases}

\item{max_snupe}{NULL or a numeric value. if numeric, an additional N balanceflow is included that takes care
that the soil nitrogen uptake efficiency does not exceed the numeric value in balanceflow.}
